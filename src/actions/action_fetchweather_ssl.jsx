	// to avoid the convulted overkill application of jQuery for this small app, we will be using another library to generate our
	// AJAX request called axios
	// this library is made solely for making ajax requests to the browser
	// again, need to make sure that syntax is correct within EVERYTHING, otherwise it will cause bugs when exporting to another component
	// was missing commas in the object properties below, caused this component to be unfetchable as a result
	return {
		
		type: FETCH_WEATHER_SSL,
		
		// now that we have the DevOps figured out for the AJAX request, we can create the payload key value for this action
		// the request PROMISE is attached to this action creator's payload
		payload: request
	};

}

// we can also write it with EMC6 syntax
 function mapStateToProps({ geocode }){

 	// this is how the function now looks
 	/*
	return { weather: weather }; */

	//this can be further condensed with ES6 like so:
	// because both the key and the value object have the same identifier
	return { geocode };
}

// if we are adding a reducer, we use mapstate to props, which is the first argument of connect, the second argument can be left empty
// since there are no actions here
